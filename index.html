<p>
This is a collection of existing Public Domain resources which can help build a completely unencumbered computer (tools, PCB, FPGA/ASIC, compiler, kernel & applications).
</p>

<p>
Please do note that so far, no effort has been made to identify possible trademark, pattent, design and other intellectual property issues which could arise from the use of these resources. Of course, in order to obtain a truely unencumbered computer, for any of these resources which are used, the offending parts for which these issues are a concern would have to be discarded or modified.
